I will be exploring the possibility of determining whether a certain user’s visual post will go viral on an unspecified social media platform. The pseudo program will count the amount of followers the creator has, the engagement, which consists of components described later, the trending topics, and if the topic of the post matches the trending topic. 

Engagement on the user’s page consists of the sum of the average number of comments, likes and shares received in the last i posts divided by the follower count. If the total interactions exceed engagement value of 1 and the trending topic matches the post’s topic, then the person’s next post will go viral. The engagement value means that the page has been receiving more interactions than the number of followers, therefore broadening their audience.

This is a very simplified description of extremely complex algorithms used by social media giants today.
